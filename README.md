# Sparkling Clean NYC

Marketing and booking website for a Manhattan cleaning service.

🌐 **Live site:** https://xiaohuahou08.github.io/CleanningSvc/

## Hosting (GitHub Pages – free)

The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main`
via the workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### One-time setup (do this once in the GitHub UI)

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Save. The next push to `main` will publish the site live.

> **No custom domain required.** The site is served for free at
> `https://xiaohuahou08.github.io/CleanningSvc/`. A custom domain is
> entirely optional – if you want one you can add it under **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**,
> but the site works perfectly without it.
